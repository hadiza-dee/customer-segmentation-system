# customer-segmentation-system

Introduction

Customer segmentation is a key strategy for businesses looking to understand their customers and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. By dividing customers into distinct groups based on characteristics such as age, income, and spending habits, businesses can develop targeted marketing strategies to better meet their customers' needs.

In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to segment customers into different groups. We explore clustering techniques like K-Means to identify patterns in the customer data and group similar customers together. The results can help businesses optimize marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction.
